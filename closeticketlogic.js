// Concerns:
// 1. Retrieving tickets: Retrieving tickets with specific criteria may require querying the CRM database using the appropriate API or query language.
// 2. Updating ticket status: Updating the status of the ticket in CRM involves using CRM API or SDK to modify the record's status field.
// 3. Sending email notifications: Sending emails from CRM may require integration with an email service or SMTP server configured in the CRM environment.
// 4. Fetching customer email address: Fetching customer email address may involve querying related entities or fields associated with the ticket record to retrieve the customer's contact information.
